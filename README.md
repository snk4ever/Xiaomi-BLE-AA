# Xiaomi-BLE-AA
3D printable case to convert Xiaomi BLE temperature and humidity sensors to 2xAA instead of 1xCR2032. Works for me with alkaline batteries.

Disclaimer: I'm not a good CAD designer. If you are, you will probably facepalm when looking at the freecad file. You've been warned. 

It's designed to be used with this AA battery holder from a French retailler:
